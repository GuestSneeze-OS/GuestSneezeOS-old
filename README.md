Arch Linux Is One Of The Best Operating Systems To Exist (I Use Arch btw) But That Does not mean Most Apps Are Compatible Most Linux Apps Support .deb. We Also Switched Because Arch Is Pretty Hard To Setup And Debian Is Just A Few Clicks And Go No Need For Ethernet. We Also Switched Because We Want Our OS Custom And Not An OS Based On An OS Based On OG Linux We Just Want OS Based On OS Based On OG Linux
