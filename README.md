# General
- Why is It Better Than HOLOISO
> HoloISO Is **NO LONGER GETTING UPDATES OR SECURITY UPDATES** And You Will Need To Find Other OS's That Are Similar To SteamOS
- What's The Difference Between The Main And The Lite
>The Lite (**GUESTSNEEZEOS LITE**) Is A Lighter Version Made For Computers With 1 GB Of Ram And Computers With Less Than 7.1 GB  Of Storage Perfect For Old Computers. The Main (**GUESTSNEEZEOS**) Is A Tad Bit Beefier Version Made For Computers With 2 GB Of RAM And 10 GB Of Storage
- I Have PowerPC CPU-
> Yes We Are Stealing This Joke From HoloISO But All CPU's And GPU's Work Very Fine But PowerPC Will Not Work With **GuestSneezeOS** Or **GuestSneezeOS Lite** Due To Its Unsupported Architecture With Debian 11 Bullseye And Steam Not Being  Supported With It.
- What CPU And GPU's Are Supported
> The GPU's From NVIDIA,INTEL,AMD Are Supported And CPU's Are Supported Are Intel (64 Bit) (Celeron 29500U And Above) And AMD CPU's (64 bit)
