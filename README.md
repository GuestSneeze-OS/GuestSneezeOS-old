# General
- Why is It Better Than HOLOISO
> HoloISO Is **NO LONGER GETTING UPDATES OR SECURITY UPDATES** And You Will Need To Find Other OS's That Are Similar To SteamOS
- What's The Difference Between The Main And The Lite
>The Lite (**GUESTSNEEZEOS LITE**) Is A Lighter Version Made For Computers With 1 GB Of Ram And Computers With Less Than 7.1 GB  Of Storage Perfect For Old Computers. The Main (**GUESTSNEEZEOS**) Is A Tad Bit Beefier Version Made For Computers With 2 GB Of RAM And 10 GB Of Storage
- I Have PowerPC CPU-
> Yes We Are Stealing This Joke From HoloISO But All CPU's And GPU's Work Very Fine But PowerPC Will Not Work With **GuestSneezeOS** Or **GuestSneezeOS Lite** Due To Its Unsupported Architecture With Debian 11 Bullseye And Steam Not Being  Supported With It.
- What CPU And GPU's Are Supported
> The GPU's From NVIDIA,INTEL,AMD Are Supported And CPU's Are Supported Are Intel (64 Bit) (Celeron 29500U And Above) And AMD CPU's (64 bit)

PowerPC Is Not And Will Never Be Supported ('_') Until Steam Games Supports PPC There Is Nothing I Can Do
