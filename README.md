# About
**GuestSneezeOS** Is An opensource OS And Its main Goal Is To Bring a SteamOS Like Experience To Both New And Old Computers. We Have Made 2 Versions GuestSneezeOS & GuestSneezeOS Lite.
<br>
despite our OS being Debian Based and not Arch based because its simpler to use. and its also lightweight (Mainly Because I Cant Connect To My Ethernet On My Arch Linux)

# Questions
- How Is It Better Than HoloISO
> Unlike HoloISO Which Is The Most SteamOS Like Alternative It Only Support's AMD CPU's And GPU's We Can Support All Kinds Of CPU's (Not PowerPC) GuestSneezeOS Comes WIth A Lite Version With Steam And All The Other Good Things You Will Need
- How Is it Better Than Nobara
> Nobara Is A Very Extremly Great Even OS Which Is Based On Fedora. Fedora Is Only 10 GB (Usually) And Nobara Is 20 GB Of System Storage Which Is Very Large On Older CPU's And GPU's And GuestSneezeOS Is 10 GB And If Thats To Big Use GuestSneezeOS Lite Its Its Only 8 GB
