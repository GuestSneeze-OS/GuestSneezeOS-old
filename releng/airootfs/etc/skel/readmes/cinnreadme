Cinnamon currently requires speech to be enabled after login.
We are working to correct this as soon as possible.
You can use the following command in the CLI to enable it for now:

dconf gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled true

Autologin is enabled during the install.
