MATE is installed with speach enabled by default.
In addition we enable autologin to prevent screen reader accesibility issues.

MATE does not set keybinds in the default install.
You may change keybinds for the environment by accessing the following menus:

Applications arrow right twice to System down once to Preferences
right once to Hardware right once then down twice to Keyboard Shortcuts

You may change accesibility settings by accessing the following menus:

Applications arrow right twice to System down once to Preferences
right once to Hardware down four times to Personal right once and down twice
